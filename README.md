# Algorithm-Project-Specific-Sorting
Write a program in C, C++, or Python that works as follows:
•      The user is allowed to choose from a printed menu the list to be sorted 
as follows:
1.  Sorted list
2.  Inversely Sorted List
3.  Random List
•      Then the user is allowed to choose the specific sorting technique to be 
applied to sort the previously selected list, among the following:
1.  Merge Sort
2.  Heap Sort
3.  Quick Sort
4.  All of them
•      The program should determine the number of comparisons, assignment 
statements and swap done for each sorting technique.
•      The program should measure the time consumed to sort the list in each 
sorting technique.
•      The program should display a comparison among the sorting techniques’ 
regarding the number of comparisons, the assignment statements and 
the time consumed to sort a random list. That’s when the user chooses 
all of them.
